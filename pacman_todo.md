# PACMAN TODO:



## DOING:

- center pacman game / move the level in  center of view (camera offset?)
- going around level's edge doesn't loop yet, but  creates a  infinite loop.

- more levels: LevelManager to handle loading and saving levels and changing them.
- change level



### BUGS:

- ghost get stuck at the ends that are open in tilemap.
- pathfinding seems to process long sometimes.
- ghosts won't move after restarting again game.


### RESEARCH:

- can ghost overlap when they move?  or do  they need to make different path to pacman?
- check ghost logic how they should move.
