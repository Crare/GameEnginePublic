# PACMAN TODO:

## DOING:

- center pacman game / move the level in  center of view (camera offset?)
- hghscores
- update UI-elements score and time.
- going around level's edge doesn't loop yet, but  creates a  infinite loop.
- add sounds
- particles when eating other entities

- more levels: LevelManager to handle loading and saving levels and changing them.
- change level


research:
- can ghost overlap when they move?  or do  they need to make different path to pacman?
- check ghost logic how they should move.
