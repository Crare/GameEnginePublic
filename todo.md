# TODO

- pong game:
    - custom font
    - fullscreen, windowed mode, scaling
    - use spritesheet for textures
    - background: scrolling background of stars?
    - powerups:
      - speedboost to paddle
      - multiple balls
      - smaller balls
      - speedball that vanishes after hitting either side of wall.
    - make ball go in the direction the paddle hit it, as in changing it's direction slightly.
- animated textures
- gamepad input / controller support. https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.html

- UI elements
    - menu buttons
        - allow using keyboard & gamepad to select (WASD or arrow keys to navigate, ESC to go back, Enter to select)
        - allow using mouse to select (Pressing buttons does the action)
