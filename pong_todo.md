# PONG TODO:

  - trailing particles behind ball
  - powerups:
    - requires Timer-class to handle boost-lifespan? store effects globally or by per paddle/ball?
    - speedboost to paddle
    - multiple balls
    - smaller balls
    - speedball that vanishes after hitting either side of wall.
  - make ball go in the direction the paddle hit it, as in changing it's direction slightly.
  - ball is not going all the way down and all the way up on screen before it turns
